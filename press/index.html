title: What Up Games, LLC
description: What Up Games, LLC is a small indie game studio that was founded in 2015 run by a husband/wife team. We pride ourselves on new and innovative ideas as well as re-imagining classic games from our childhood. While we are always working on new ideas, we love to collaborate with individuals or companies who need help in bringing their vision to fruition. Additionally, we enjoy contributing to the game development community by providing online tutorials and helping on numerous community sites.
