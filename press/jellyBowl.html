title: Jelly Bowl
description: Once every few years, a Jelly Bowl is held to determine who the next ruler of all of Jelly World will be. Princess Magenta of the Six Kingdoms has selected you, her secret love, to be her champion. You must win the Jelly Bowl to prove your love and secure her place as the rightful ruler! </br> </br> Jelly Bowl is a fast-paced competitive game in which each player battles to collect the most amount of energy. Use your three offense abilities (range attack, melee attack and a shock wave) and defensive ability (shield) strategically to protect your energy or steal from other players.
features:
- title: <b>Strategic Gameplay:</b> Each player has a set of four abilities that must be timed perfectly to avoid having your points stolen before you bank or to steal from other jellyâ€™s.
- title: <b>Multiple Classes:</b> Choose the play style that suites you - be it a heavier defense at the cost of weaker attack abilities, stronger attacks at the cost of weaker defense or the middle of the road.
- title: <b>Fast-Paced Competitive:</b> Fight up to six of your friends locally.
- title: <b>Practice:</b> Play against the AI to hone your skills before going head to head. 
gameModes:
 - title: Jelly Hunters
   description: Jelly Hunters is a free for all where you must battle to collect the most amount of energy before the timer runs out. The more points you collect before banking, the higher the reward. You'll also move slower and grow in size. Beware, if you are hit just once you'll eject every point that you've grabbed for others to steal!
 - title: Capture the Flag
   description: In capture the flag, you have one goal - be the first team to collect five energies. Energy will spawn randomly throughout the level which you can grab. Or, if you are feeling more adventurous, you can steal what the other team has already banked. The choice is yours!
- title: Jelly Racers
   description: Race through Jelly Bowl's specialized arena while trying to slow down your opponent using traps, abilities and your wits!
