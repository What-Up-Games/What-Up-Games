We are pleased to announce that Nothin' But Net will enter Early Access (EA) via Steam on November 17th! While this is about two weeks later than we'd originally planned for, some aspects of the game were not feeling quite as polished as we would like. We thought you guys might enjoy hearing about some of the features that will be in the first early access release!

Once again, we’d like to thank everyone who provided feedback after playing the Nothin’ But Net demo. It has been instrumental in helping us refine the game play and track down some pesky bugs. Also, for those of you that we met at PAX West - We will be sending the winners of the competition the details on how to unlock their free copy closer to the EA launch date. 
<br/>
<h3 style="padding-top:15px;">Game Modes</h3>
Nothin’ But Net will have five single player game modes at the Early Access launch. We’d originally planned to include online Free-Throw but have encountered a few hiccups which we are working to resolve as quickly as possible and hopefully in time for launch.
<br/><br/>
<b>H.O.R.S.E.</b><br/>
We’d also originally planned to design H.O.R.S.E. as an online only game mode. We enjoyed playing it so much that we wanted to bring it to singleplayer as well. So, we taught KB how to play and made sure that his skill scales to match yours. In H.O.R.S.E., you alternate taking turns shooting a basket from a position of your choice. If you miss a shot setup by KB, you gain a letter and vice-versa. The first to spell the entire word (of your choosing) loses.

<br/>
<b>Full-Court Mixup and Full-Court Challenge</b><br/>
We’ve added two new game modes called Full-Court Mixup and Full-Court Challenge. Both game modes will have you rapidly teleporting around the entire gymnasium trying to make shots as quickly as possible in the time allotted. Full-Court Challenge adds a variation to the game by blocking your way with an obstacle, making it so you must shoot through a moving/rotating hoop and into the basket. 

<br/>
<b>Rapid Fire</b><br/>
The more we played Rapid Fire, the more we felt that it hadn’t reached its fullest potential. We’ve begun redesigning how the game mode functions and are planning on releasing the first iteration of those changes. Rapid Fire tests your ability to shoot without having much time to aim your shot. Score as many points possible in the time given, taking your shot before the ball disappears.

<br/>
<b>Free Throw</b><br/>
Free Throw opens up the gymnasium, letting you do what you want, when you want. In this game mode, all settings and features are enabled, making it the perfect place to explore the other features that Nothin’ But Net has to offer. You can also adjust the height of the hoops in this mode, which was a popular request from players.
<br/>
<h3 style="padding-top:15px;">Additional Features</h3>
We’re currently working on several features which are completed to varying degrees. Rather than holding onto all of them until they are 100% polished, we thought it would be great to start collecting feedback on two – Court Customization and Object Spawning.

Court customization lets you change the primary and secondary banner colors in addition to the center court logo. You can also import your own logo. Object spawning is a feature being designed primarily for online H.O.R.S.E. For now, you can play around in Free Throw mode by spawning various objects and saving/loading court layouts. We have some fun plans of these features, both online and offline! 
<br/>
<h3 style="padding-top:15px;">Leaderboards and Achievements</h3>
Unfortunately, the first Early Access launch of Nothin’ But Net will not have achievement or leaderboard integration, though support is planned. You will earn credit for past achievements and your proper leaderboard ranking once the feature has been implemented.
