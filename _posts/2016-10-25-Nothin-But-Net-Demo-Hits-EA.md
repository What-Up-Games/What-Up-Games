Happy Thanksgiving! We hope all of you are enjoying a wonderful day with your friends and families. We here at What Up Games are thankful to have our first game on Steam and for all of you who have decided to take this journey with us. 

We’ve just released the first update for Nothin’ But Net which has a few new features and bug fixes. In it, you’ll find a new game mode, Steam Leaderboard support and other fixes.

<h3 style="padding-top:15px;">Three Point Shootout </h3>
We’ve brought the classic NBA game, Three Point Shootout, to Nothin’ But Net. As with all game modes in Nothin’ But Net – skill is required! In Three Point Shootout, you have one minute to make 25 shots from five positions around the three-point line into a regulation height hoop. The orange balls reward one point and the black/red balls reward two points. 

<h3 style="padding-top:15px;">Steam Leaderboard Support </h3>
You can now see how you rank against other players in solo game modes via the Steam Leaderboards! Full rankings are available on the Community Hub and your overall online rank (which is calculated per game mode by difficulty) is displayed on the Game Mode menu. This is just the beginning of the statistics and ranking features that we have planned! 

<h3 style="padding-top:15px;">General </h3>
We’ve also included several smaller fixes: 

<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that was preventing the left controller from being used with the ball for both Oculus Touch and HTC Vive. </li>
<li>When in the rafters, the menu will always appear to the right of the player to prevent accidental spawning in the wall. </li>
<li>The menu now defaults to open with a random mode selected after completing the tutorial. </li>
<li>Players who completed the tutorial will be greeted with the menu when first launching the game. </li>
<li>General bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
