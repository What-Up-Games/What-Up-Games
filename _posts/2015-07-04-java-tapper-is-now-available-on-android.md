We are super pleased to announce that Java Tapper has been officially released! This is just the first game mode, as several more are planned. Download Java Tapper for free <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatupgames.javatapper" target="_blank">here</a>.

Java Tapper is a fun new twist on the original tapper style video game. Customers will come into your coffee house wanting either a donut, a breakfast sandwich or a coffee. Tap up and down the three aisles to serve them the type of food that they want before they reach the end. Youâ€™ll be fired if you forget to pick up a tip or break a plate by serving it down an aisle without an eagerly waiting customer!

<b>Instructions:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Tap on an aisle to move your server.</li>
	<li>Send the customer the item in their bubble by tapping the food/drink icon on the right.</li>
	<li>Collect the tip that the customer sends back.</li>
</ul>
<b>Features:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Leaderboard integration allows you to compete with friends to see who can get the highest score.</li>
	<li>Earn creative achievements by challenging the way you play.</li>
</ul>
