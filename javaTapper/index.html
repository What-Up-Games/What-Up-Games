friendlyDescription: Java Tapper is a fun new twist on the original Tapper  video game released by Bally Midway in 1983. In Java Tapper, customers will come into your coffee house wanting one of three menu items. Tap up and down the three aisles to serve them what they want before they reach the end. You'll be fired if you forget to pick up a tip or break a plate by serving it down an aisle without an eagerly waiting customer!
platform: Java Tapper is available on Game Jolt and Google Play. Both versions integrate with the respective Leaderboard and trophies/achievements.
status: Released
